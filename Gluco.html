<h3>Biotin:<br />
Regulates blood sugar levels and prevents insulin resistance through complex cellular processes, influencing glucose metabolism.</h3>

<h3>Gymnema Sylvestre:<br />
Gymnemic acids in Gymnema Sylvestre temporarily suppress sweetness perception and disrupt glucose absorption, leading to reduced blood glucose levels.</h3>

<h3>Manganese:<br />
Acts as a cofactor for enzymes, influencing protein glycosylation and exhibiting antioxidant properties, mitigating oxidative stress linked to insulin resistance.</h3>

<h3>Chromium:<br />
Facilitates insulin binding to its receptor, crucial for glucose uptake, and amplifies insulin receptor kinase activity, intensifying insulin signaling.</h3>

<h3>Cinnamon:<br />
Stimulates insulin receptor autophosphorylation and inhibits enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, addressing both insulin signaling and glucose production.</h3>

<h3>Licorice Root:<br />
Glycyrrhizin in licorice root has anti-inflammatory properties, reducing inflammation-associated insulin resistance and indirectly contributing to improved insulin sensitivity.</h3>
